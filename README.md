There are the following projects:

* **"Prediction of the winning team of the Qatar 2022 World Cup"**. It has been developed in 4 notebooks: 
[Notebook1](https://github.com/JoshepB3/NewRepository3/blob/main/1_2022_WC_Qatar_Data_collection.ipynb) | 
[Notebook2](https://github.com/JoshepB3/NewRepository3/blob/main/2_2022_WC_Qatar_Data_collection.ipynb) | 
[Notebook3](https://github.com/JoshepB3/NewRepository3/blob/main/3_2022_WC_Qatar_Data_cleaning.ipynb) | 
[Notebook4](https://github.com/JoshepB3/NewRepository3/blob/main/4_2022_WC_Qatar_Model_creation.ipynb).
Knowledge of web scraping was applied with the *Pandas* and *BeautifulSoup4* libraries to obtain the data of both the current fixture 
and the matches of the previous World Cups. 
For the prediction of the winner of the World Cup, the *"Poisson Probability Distribution"* was applied.
* Application of unsupervised learning with non-hierarchical **"clustering of wines"**:
[Notebook](https://github.com/JoshepB3/NewRepository3/blob/main/wine_clustering.ipynb). 
***K-means*** was the Machine Learning algorithm used for clustering, to obtain the optimal value of clusters, 
the *Elbow Method*, also known as the Jambu Method, was used. 
First, the data was scaled in the range from 0 to 1. 
Dimensionality reduction was performed with the *PCA Method* and thus, half of its dimensions were used 
(it covered approximately 90% of the variance). 
Finally, a classification was made according to the average value of its characteristics.
